The Cat API - API Key

Thanks for signing up, welcome to the The Cat API!

Here's your API key:

live_4wKIZj63d0cfWTAKiJDaQLQosdxjE8s8gDEFQaOOqnDDRaOrWDvtOBgUlGGK2hkO

Use it as the 'x-api-key' header when making any request to the API, or by adding as a query string parameter e.g. 'api_key=live_4wKIZj63d0cfWTAKiJDaQLQosdxjE8s8gDEFQaOOqnDDRaOrWDvtOBgUlGGK2hkO'

ðŸ“£ ðŸ“£ ðŸ“£ Thinking of building your own API?
Designing and coding a cool new API is the easy part. But what about the auth management and rate limiting?

Did you know, the The Cat API launched in 2012, and we've had over 30k signups since launching?

That's a lot of requests and a lot of API keys we've generated (including yours ðŸ‘† ðŸ˜€ ). We've taken that learning and built a lightweight SDK to solve how you handle your API keys and rate limiting (plus a bunch of other really cool features).
